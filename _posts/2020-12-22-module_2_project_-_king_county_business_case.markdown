Introduction
Objective
As a real estate consultancy we deal with various clients and problems and our primary obligation is to understand the housing market. We cover the entirety of King County, Washington and aim to provide a comprehensive resolution to whatever requests our clients might make. Here are several questions that we have worked through as a firm to both bolster our understanding of the area and to facilitate customer requsts.

Question 1

With which single feature of a property is it easiest to guess the value of a property?

We will not always have access to our data team and it is vital that we are able to gain as much insight from as little information as possible.

Question 2

A buyer approaches the firm looking for advice on purchasing a property against the following criteria

Minimum two bed

No real restriction on price

Plan to resell within a period of five years and wants a healthy profit

Buyer is prepared to invest in property.

The aim here is to identify features and areas where there is most likely to be an increase in price over the near term. This may include recommending properties that could easily be upgraded

Question 3

A real estate developer approaches the firm looking to expand into King County. What advice would you give them? How could they best realize a healthy profit with the insights this dataset offers? This developer is aimed at identifying cheaper opportunities and investing larger sums of money into long term develoment.

What areas and properties can we identify that would satisfy those criteria?

But before we get to looking at these questions, can we create as accurate as possible, an equation for predicting house prices in King County based on features?
